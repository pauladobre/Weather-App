#  WEATHER APP

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a web application that displays the current weather information for a given location. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Open Weather API for weather data.

## Usage
The weather application is designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for their current location or any location they search for. In order to access this information, users must allow location sharing. Once the user shares their location, the application will display the current temperature, weather description, and an icon that represents the current weather conditions.

Additionally, the application offers a search function where the user can search for any location they desire. If the user finds a location they want to keep track of, they can add it to a favorites section for quick and easy access in the future. The user also has the ability to remove a location from their favorites.

The images correspond with different types of weather conditions to enhance the user experience. The images will change based on the current weather, providing a visual representation of the current conditions.
